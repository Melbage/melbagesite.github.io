# Melbage Golf Socity Website Data Project

The website has been in use now for almost year years and the data for the orginal site was created with Microsoft pages 6.0 and excel files saved as html. 

## Description

The idea behind this project is to convert the the excel files to to a better text based format (csv or json) and wrap the data in JavaScript and display using a defaults CSS template.  The website has been hosted and now wants to be converted to a jekins site (jamstack)
